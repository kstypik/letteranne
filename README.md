## Development

### Prerequisites

- Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- Install [just](https://github.com/casey/just) to run project tasks (optional, but recommended; if you don't install it you have to copy-paste commands from justfile to follow the rest of this section)
- Install [asdf](https://asdf-vm.com/) to manage versions of Node.js and Python (optional)
- Install [EditorConfig](https://editorconfig.org/) to keep coding style consistent (optional)

### Setting up your local environment

Clone the repo with git:

```bash
# by using https...
git clone https://github.com/kstypik/letteranne.git
# ... OR by using SSH
git clone git@github.com:kstypik/letteranne.git
```

Move to the directory:

```bash
cd letteranne
```

With `just` installed, you can run the command below to set the local environment variables and build Docker images:

```bash
just setup
```

After the setup, you can start the containers by simply typing:

```bash
just up -d
```

**Note:** -d flag is for using the detached mode in Docker, so your terminal won't be connected to the container

If everything was correct, your local application should be up and running under localhost:8000

## Production Deployment

TBD

## Name origin

The name came to my mind while reading L.M. Montgomery's book *Anne of Windy Poplars* which largely consists of letters Anne wrote to her fianc√© Gilbert.
